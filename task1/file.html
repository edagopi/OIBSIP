  <p>The first international cricket match was played between Canada and the United States, on 24 and 25 September 1844.[7] However, the first credited Test match was played in 1877 between Australia and England, and the two teams competed regularly for The Ashes in subsequent years. South Africa was admitted to Test status in 1889.[8] Representative cricket teams were selected to tour each other, resulting in bilateral competition. Cricket was also included as an Olympic sport at the 1900 Paris Games, where Great Britain defeated France to win the gold medal.[9] This was the only appearance of cricket at the Summer Olympics.[10]

    The first multilateral competition at international level was the 1912 Triangular Tournament, a Test cricket tournament played in England between all three Test-playing nations at the time: England, Australia and South Africa. The event was not a success: the summer was exceptionally wet, making play difficult on damp uncovered pitches, and crowd attendances were poor, attributed to a "surfeit of cricket".[11] Since then, international Test cricket has generally been organised as bilateral series: a multilateral Test tournament was not organised again until the triangular Asian Test Championship in 1999.[12]
    
    The number of nations playing Test cricket increased gradually over time, with the addition of West Indies in 1928,[13] New Zealand in 1930,[14] India in 1932,[15] and Pakistan in 1952.[16] However, international cricket continued to be played as bilateral Test matches over three, four or five days.
